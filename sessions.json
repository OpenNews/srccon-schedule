        "shortdescription": "Most newsrooms don't employ developers. In the lucky places with developers who are allowed to work on news projects, these journalists have a litany of common complaints: nobody understands what I do, nobody understands how databases/the internet/computers work, nobody respects how much time it takes to do this kind of work well. \n\nThere are a lot of reasons for this that we won't be able to solve in an hour, but one legacy we need to overcome is the firmly entrenched organization and management structure of the newspaper itself. For 100 years, reporters sat together with their colleagues who covered the same beat. They reported a story, wrote it up and handed it to an editor who read it. He (almost always a he), edited it, demanded a photo or chart to illustrate it, and then handed it to the copy desk to fix typos and place on a page in the next morning's paper. Repeat for another 40 years until you drop dead at your desk. \n\nObviously, nearly everything about our readers and our industry has changed dramatically in the past three decades, but our newsroom structures are remarkably unchanged. In some places, there may be a separate \"digital\" wing lashed on to the side of the org chart, or a \"real-time\" desk that handles web production. In many newsrooms, reporters report (and tweet and shoot video...), write and hand their product off to someone else to put on the web and in print. They are utterly divorced from doing anything online outside of a rigid CMS.\n\nAs journalist-developers, we know how to build apps for the web. We can visualize data and design engaging user experiences on tablet or mobile. In this session, I'd like us to talk about how we can redesign the newsroom itself to upend our clunky workflows pegged to Sunday's newspaper instead of today's news online. \n\nIf you were the editor of your average major metro daily, how would you redraw your organization to make this work?\n*How can we redesign our newsrooms to bring news developers into the reporting process at the beginning and to help everyone else master new skills? \n* Should we adopt Ben Welsh's philosophy that we ought to train web producers to become news devs and not just SEO-experts and explainer explainers? \n* Should we follow Scott Klein's model of making every developer a reporter, designer and data expert?\n* How many AMEs do you really need? \n* Should web producers sit together or with the copy desk and paginators? Should they be in the same room/floor/building/state as reporters and editors? \n* What are the jobs that really need to be done here?\n\nThis exercise is about more than just rearranging deck chairs. Together, we can wipe the slate clean and design a newsroom that builds skills throughout the organization and forces people to think smarter about the internet as a primary medium rather than an afterthought.",

They work on different time scales. They frequently design their own experiment and collect their own data, rather than inheriting data from a third party.\n\nBut, appropriately or not, there is a perception of data journalism as edging closer to science, in the forms of its analysis and in a trend towards collecting its own raw data. This is an intriguing trend but also pretty dangerous; data journalism can wind up carrying the veneer of scientific rigor without the real thing.\n\nLet's talk about it. Subtopics may include:\n\n-Should/can journalists better adopt the norms of the scientific community (openness, peer review, reproducibility, incremental discovery, uncertainty)? If so, how can we accomplish that without sacrificing other priorities?\n-Experiment-driven journalism vs. retrospective analysis\n-Citizen science initiatives\n-Potential for closer partnerships between scientists and journalists on individual stories\n-For mandatory symmetry in conference topics: what can scientists learn from journalists?",

The city of Philadelphia hired a chief data officer in 2012 and has been steadily releasing public data sets through opendataphilly.org over the past few years. This spring, the city of Pittsburgh took steps to follow that lead, passing an open data ordinance and even more recently hiring a data coordinator to help city departments build an open data catalog and begin its release of information. \n\nI’m interested in having a conversation about what our role, as journalists/news organizations, should be in this effort. \n\nA couple of topics worth exploring: \n\n* What should our relationship be with the tech communities / open data enthusiasts? We are experienced at working with government data and understand the challenges, pitfalls and potential power of using it to tell stories about our communities. Should we be lending our expertise and partnering with open data groups? Or should we remain independent observers and fact-checkers of their work, treating them as another beat to cover? What are the pros and cons?\n\n* The open data groups have already proven to be a powerful lobby on behalf of freedom of information laws. How should we work with them to ensure that local and state laws continue to be friendly and more open? On the flip side, how should we prepare to mitigate the risks of more restrictive laws being enacted if an open data experiment goes wrong (i.e., backlash against certain information being published or interpreted and published incorrectly?) \n\n* Related to all of the above: If we talk of partnering, what are the ways we can balance our business interests with the open data ethos?",
