SRCCON Schedule
===============

The code underneath the schedule app for SRCCON. Some short notes on the current version:

* published via the wonderful GitHub Pages
* stores data in a single json file, generated by [a Python script](https://github.com/OpenNews/schedule-data-loader) that pulls data from a Google Docs spreadsheet
* provides a full, searchable session list in addition to daily schedule tabs
* highlights schedule tab for current date if possible
* uses localstorage for session favoriting, populating a per-device custom schedule tab
* _can_ use appcache, such as it is, to provide offline support for those special conference wifi moments
    * repo includes local versions of OpenSans font files, to get around cache manifest fetching bugs in some browsers
    * does its best to handle "back" navigation in offline mode, where there is no `window.history`
* relies on jQuery and Underscore for DOM and data manipulation
* uses [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) for pretty text formatting

Some components are bespoke. For example:

* variable names for session metadata are currently tied to the data layout for our SRCCON planning spreadsheet
* tab dates are defined in the schedule template, rather than calculated by looking for unique values from the list of sessions
* color categories are tied to SRCCON's 1- and 2.5-hour session formats
