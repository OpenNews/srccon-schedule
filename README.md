SRCCON Schedule
===============

The code underneath the schedule app for SRCCON 2014. Some short notes on the current version:

* published via the wonderful GitHub Pages
* stores data in a single json file, generated by:
    * downloading data as CSV from a Google Docs spreadsheet
    * `csvjson -i 4 srccon_sessions.csv > sessions.json` (thanks, [csvkit](https://github.com/onyxfish/csvkit)!)
* provides a full, searchable session list in addition to day-by-day schedule tabs
* highlights schedule tab for current date if possible
* uses localstorage for session favoriting, populating a per-device custom schedule tab
* uses appcache, such as it is, to provide offline support for those special conference wifi moments
    * repo includes local versions of OpenSans font files, to get around cache manifest fetching bugs in some browsers
    * does its best to handle "back" navigation in offline mode, where there is no `window.history`
* relies on jQuery and Underscore for DOM and data manipulation
* enjoys using [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) for pretty text formatting

This app was built on the fly in the week before SRCCON 2014, so some components are fairly bespoke. For example:

* variable names for session metadata are currently tied to the data layout for our SRCCON planning spreadsheet
* tab dates are defined in `schedule.js` itself, rather than calculated by looking for unique values from the list of sessions
* color categories are tied tightly to SRCCON 2014's 1- and 2.5-hour session formats

I'm hoping to address these issues, as well as a few others, before SRCCON 2015.
